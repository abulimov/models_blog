      <description>Once I built up some confidence with wooden kits, especially after St. Gabriel I felt confident enough to start the &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; wooden ship. Like you know, one which you have to plank manually and scratch-build most of the stuff. As you probably know, picking the right subject you are really interested in is the key to success. Especially when built is expected to take many months. After careful considerations and reading Model Ship World a lot, I picked this kit from OcCre.</description>

      <description>This tiny kit was purchased to compliment HMS Terror.
OcCre provided cast metal boats with Terror kit, however I lack artistic talent to make them presentable enough to pass for wood.
For this reason I took measures of biggest boat that was intended to be put on ship&amp;rsquo;s deck, and ordered similarly sized boat kit from Vanguard Models.
Model quality It is made by Vanguard Models, by legendary Chris Watton, so I had no doubts the kit will be great.</description>

      <description>This tiny kit was purchased to compliment HMS Terror.
OcCre provided cast metal boats with Terror kit, however I lack artistic talent to make them presentable enough to pass for wood.
For this reason I took measures of biggest boat that was intended to be put on ship&amp;rsquo;s deck, and ordered similarly sized boat kit from Vanguard Models.
Model quality It is made by Vanguard Models, by legendary Chris Watton, so I had no doubts the kit will be great.</description>

      <description>I wanted to build a cutter since I first saw someone else build in the modelshipworld.com gallery. They look very graceful and elegant and fast!
HM Cutter Lady Nelson Funny enough, there was no such ship, instead this model depicts an abstract 18th-century British cutter, inspired by Sherbourne-class. As I was attracted by the looks of the subject, not by the history of a particular ship, it didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me.</description>

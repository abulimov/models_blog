      <description>Continuing the series of retrospectives, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at year 2023.&#xA;While in a global, geopolitical sense the year was just as bad as 2022 (at least from my perspective), from the modelling standpoint it was actually fairly good.&#xA;On the surface of it, I only completed two models. But it&amp;rsquo;s the model that count, not the total number.&#xA;HMS Terror I&amp;rsquo;m delighted that the dreaded HMS Terror is finally finished!</description>

      <description>I like the ‘year in review’ format I tried for the first time last year, so here we go again.&#xA;No point in sugarcoating it - 2022 was a terrible, terrible year, with horrible war starting in Europe. Of course this affected all parts of my life, including hobbies, as I was too depressed and anxious to bring myself back to it.&#xA;Eventually I managed (or rather forced myself) to do at least some modelling, if anything because it calms me and improves my mental health.</description>

      <description>First time I’m doing this ‘year in review’ thing, decided to give it a try.&#xA;Turns out, I only completed two models this year, mostly thanks to the fact that sailing ships take enormous amount of time to finish.&#xA;I track the days I worked on the models, but not the amount of time, which of course varies from 20 minutes to multiple hours. I can work on more than one model in a single day, so adding those numbers up is kinda misleading.</description>

      <description>RNLI Shannon Class Lifeboat Shannon class is the latest class of lifeboats currently being deployed to the RNLI fleet in UK and here in Ireland. With the hull designed by the Northern Irish naval architect Peter Eyre, the class is named after the river Shannon.&#xA;I bought this kit on IPMS Ireland Nationals 2024 (lovely show with some spectacular models on display), which adds an emotional attachment to the enjoyment of building it.</description>

      <description>This model attracted me because of graceful, beautiful lines, and my desire to try a recent model by famous Chris Watton. After all, I quite enjoyed his design in Lady Nelson, and the kits from Vanguard Models had glowing reviews on a Model Ship World forum.&#xA;HM Brig Sloop Flirt There is nothing remarkable about ship herself. She was built in 1782 and had a relatively uneventful career in the Navy.</description>

      <title>[WIP] HMS Alert, 1/48, Trident Models</title>

      <description>Since I started building wooden kits, I looked at the Plank-on-Frame models with great awe. Exposing the internal structure of the ship with all the beautiful complexity is extremely appealing to me as an engineer.&#xA;This year my wife convinced me to take the plunge and try to build one myself.&#xA;After building 10+ wooden models I felt confident enough to attempt building some small and well-made POF kit.&#xA;Seeing a group build for this model on Ships of Scale forums, along with the positive reviews and acceptable price (around 600EUR after import taxes) helped me to make the decision in favour of this kit from the new Chinese manufacturer Trident Models.</description>

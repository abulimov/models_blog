      <description>I wanted to build a cutter since I first saw someone else&amp;rsquo;s build in the modelshipworld.com gallery. They look very graceful and elegant and fast!
HM Cutter Lady Nelson Funny enough, there was no such ship, instead this model depicts an abstract 18th-century British cutter, inspired by Sherbourne-class. As I was attracted by the looks of the subject, not by the history of a particular ship, it didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me.</description>

      <description>With this small and simple kit I wanted to get a break from rigging HMS Terror I&amp;rsquo;ve been building for over a year now.
Providence Whaleboat Typical whaleboat used for whaling during the 19th century in New England. Such boats were carried on board of whaling ships and used to hunt and harpoon whales.
While I definitely disapprove whaling as a practice, the whaleboat itself is quite a beautiful subject.</description>

      <title>Four-oared yawl of XIX century, 1/24, Falkonet, 2020</title>

      <description>Another wooden model. The more I build them, the more I love doing it.
The manufacturer is a Russian company called Falkonet, they specialize in extremely detailed kits.
Four-oared yawl of XIX century Not much to say about the subject, it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly typical yawl from that age. The box says it&amp;rsquo;s based on real historical plans from 19th century, by English shipwright Benjamin Stuckey.
Model quality It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely excellent, level of details is insane and superior to what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in other manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s kits.</description>

      <description>Once I built up some confidence with wooden kits, especially after St. Gabriel I felt confident enough to start the &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; wooden ship. Like you know, one which you have to plank manually and scratch-build most of stuff. As you probably know, picking the right subject you are really interested in is the key to success. Especially when built is expected to take many months. After careful considerations and reading Model Ship World a lot, I picked this kit from OcCre.</description>

      <title>Boat 1763, 1/72, Falkonet, 2019</title>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t really help it - wooden models attract me more and more. This one is yet another tiny boat kit that I bought for like 10 Euros on my trip to Russia.
The manufacturer is Falkonet, apparently they focus on smaller stuff like boats and yachts, no tall ships in the catalog so far.
Wooden boat from year 1763 Some luxurious wooden boat from Catherine The Great era. Well, basically a typical 6-oar boat with ornaments on the side.</description>

      <description>For some reason wooden kits keep attracting me more and more. This one is the third I&amp;rsquo;m building, all from the same Russian company called Master Korabel (Мастер Корабел).
St. Gabriel deck-boat This was the main ship of the First Kamchatka Expedition lead by Danish explorer Vitus Bering for Russian Tsar Peter The Great in 1724-1730.
Model quality Just as with previous kits from this company I had no major issues with the model, wooden parts are awesome and very well engineered.</description>

      <description>After I visited famous HMS Victory in Portsmouth this summer, I wanted to build something related to her.
My experience with wooden kits tells me that building the full HMS Victory model is a very big project that I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for yet, not to mention the sheer size of it. So building this kit allowed me to scratch that HMS Victory itch without spending a year on it.
English Carronade Carronade is a short cannon that was used by the Royal Navy, and HMS Victory carries two of such cannons on her forecastle.</description>

      <description>As I had great fun building my first wooden kit, on my next trip to Russia I bought a bunch of other kits from local manufacturers. This modern kit is again from Russian company called Master Korabel (Мастер Корабел), is fully laser-cut and costs less than 10 Euros.
Launch This is just a general purpose boat used on sail ships in 17th century. Nothing really special about it.
Model quality Just as with previous kit from this company I had no issues, fit was almost perfect.</description>

      <description>My first ever wooden kit, yay! I was always intimidated by wooden ship kits, assuming huge amount of scratch-building and crafting. Also I knew from my childhood plastic kit experience that rigging is quite challenging on Tall Ships.
Luckily nowadays thanks to modern technologies like laser cutters and CAD software wooden kits are enhanced with pre-shaped laser cut hull planks and details.
Considering this I decided to give it a try and build something relatively simple, relatively cheap and without complex rigging.</description>

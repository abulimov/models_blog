      <title>[WIP] HMS Alert, 1/48, Trident Models</title>

      <description>Since I started building wooden kits, I looked at the Plank-on-Frame models with great awe. Exposing the internal structure of the ship with all the beautiful complexity is extremely appealing to me as an engineer.&#xA;This year my wife convinced me to take the plunge and try to build one myself.&#xA;After building 10+ wooden models I felt confident enough to attempt building some small and well-made POF kit.&#xA;Seeing a group build for this model on Ships of Scale forums, along with the positive reviews and acceptable price (around 600EUR after import taxes) helped me to make the decision in favour of this kit from the new Chinese manufacturer Trident Models.</description>

      <title>[WIP] HMS Flirt, 1/64, Vanguard Models</title>
      <link>//models.bulimov.me/models/vanguard-flirt/</link>

      <description>This model attracted me because of graceful, beautiful lines, and my desire to try a recent model by famous Chris Watton. After all, I quite enjoyed his design in Lady Nelson, and the kits from Vanguard Models had glowing reviews on a Model Ship World forum.&#xA;HM Brig Sloop Flirt There is nothing remarkable about ship herself. She was built in 1782 and had a relatively uneventful career in the Navy.</description>

      <title>HMS Terror, 1/75, OcCre</title>

      <description>Once I built up some confidence with wooden kits, especially after St. Gabriel I felt confident enough to start the &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; wooden ship. Like you know, one which you have to plank manually and scratch-build most of the stuff. As you probably know, picking the right subject you are really interested in is the key to success. Especially when built is expected to take many months. After careful considerations and reading Model Ship World a lot, I picked this kit from OcCre.</description>

      <title>24ft Cutter, 1/64, Vanguard Models</title>
      <link>//models.bulimov.me/models/vanguard-24ft-cutter/</link>

      <guid>//models.bulimov.me/models/vanguard-24ft-cutter/</guid>
      <description>This tiny kit was purchased to compliment HMS Terror.&#xA;OcCre provided cast metal boats with Terror kit, however I lack artistic talent to make them presentable enough to pass for wood.&#xA;For this reason I took measures of biggest boat that was intended to be put on ship&amp;rsquo;s deck, and ordered similarly sized boat kit from Vanguard Models.&#xA;Model quality It is made by Vanguard Models, by legendary Chris Watton, so I had no doubts the kit will be great.</description>

      <title>Leudo, 1/48, Falkonet</title>
      <link>//models.bulimov.me/models/falkonet-leudo/</link>

      <guid>//models.bulimov.me/models/falkonet-leudo/</guid>
      <description>Leudo Leudo is a type of cargo ship, used in Mediterranean Sea to carry various goods. Of course, most people familiar with the subject will think about the wine-carrying type of Leudo, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what this model depicts.&#xA;Model quality This is an upgraded Pear version of the kit, so the material quality is very good.&#xA;But I have few issues with the design of the kit. Unlike Falkonet&amp;rsquo;s Yawl which was superb, this kit feels over-engineered to the point where it detracts from builder&amp;rsquo;s experience.</description>

      <title>Lady Nelson, 1/64, Amati</title>

      <description>I wanted to build a cutter since I first saw someone else build in the modelshipworld.com gallery. They look very graceful and elegant and fast!&#xA;HM Cutter Lady Nelson Funny enough, there was no such ship, instead this model depicts an abstract 18th-century British cutter, inspired by Sherbourne-class. As I was attracted by the looks of the subject, not by the history of a particular ship, it didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me.</description>

      <description>With this small and simple kit I wanted to get a break from rigging HMS Terror I&amp;rsquo;ve been building for over a year now.&#xA;Providence Whaleboat Typical whaleboat used for whaling during the 19th century in New England. Such boats were carried on board of whaling ships and used to hunt and harpoon whales.&#xA;While I definitely disapprove whaling as a practice, the whaleboat itself is quite a beautiful subject.</description>

      <title>Four-oared yawl of XIX century, 1/24, Falkonet</title>

      <guid>//models.bulimov.me/models/falkonet-yawl/</guid>
      <description>Another wooden model. The more I build them, the more I love doing it.&#xA;The manufacturer is a Russian company called Falkonet, they specialize in extremely detailed kits.&#xA;Four-oared yawl of XIX century Not much to say about the subject, it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly typical yawl from that age. The box says it&amp;rsquo;s based on real historical plans from 19th century, by English shipwright Benjamin Stuckey.&#xA;Model quality It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely excellent, level of details is insane and superior to what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in other manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s kits.</description>

      <title>Boat 1763, 1/72, Falkonet</title>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t really help it - wooden models attract me more and more. This one is yet another tiny boat kit that I bought for like 10 Euros on my trip to Russia.&#xA;The manufacturer is Falkonet, apparently they focus on smaller stuff like boats and yachts, no tall ships in the catalog so far.&#xA;Wooden boat from year 1763 Some luxurious wooden boat from Catherine The Great era. Well, basically a typical 6-oar boat with ornaments on the side.</description>

      <description>For some reason wooden kits keep attracting me more and more. This one is the third I&amp;rsquo;m building, all from the same Russian company called Master Korabel (Мастер Корабел).&#xA;St Gabriel deck-boat This was the main ship of the First Kamchatka Expedition lead by Danish explorer Vitus Bering for Russian Tsar Peter The Great in 1724-1730.&#xA;Model quality Just as with previous kits from this company I had no major issues with the model, wooden parts are awesome and very well engineered.</description>

      <description>After I visited famous HMS Victory in Portsmouth this summer, I wanted to build something related to her.&#xA;My experience with wooden kits tells me that building the full HMS Victory model is a very big project that I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for yet, not to mention the sheer size of it. So building this kit allowed me to scratch that HMS Victory itch without spending a year on it.&#xA;English Carronade Carronade is a short cannon that was used by the Royal Navy, and HMS Victory carries two of such cannons on her forecastle.</description>

      <description>As I had great fun building my first wooden kit, on my next trip to Russia I bought a bunch of other kits from local manufacturers. This modern kit is again from Russian company called Master Korabel (Мастер Корабел), is fully laser-cut and costs less than 10 Euros.&#xA;Launch This is just a general purpose boat used on sail ships in 17th century. Nothing really special about it.&#xA;Model quality Just as with previous kit from this company I had no issues, fit was almost perfect.</description>

      <description>My first ever wooden kit, yay! I was always intimidated by wooden ship kits, assuming huge amount of scratch-building and crafting. Also I knew from my childhood plastic kit experience that rigging is quite challenging on Tall Ships.&#xA;Luckily nowadays thanks to modern technologies like laser cutters and CAD software wooden kits are enhanced with pre-shaped laser cut hull planks and details.&#xA;Considering this I decided to give it a try and build something relatively simple, relatively cheap and without complex rigging.</description>

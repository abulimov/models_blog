      <description>RNLI Shannon Class Lifeboat Shannon class is the latest class of lifeboats currently being deployed to the RNLI fleet in UK and here in Ireland. With the hull designed by the Northern Irish naval architect Peter Eyre, the class is named after the river Shannon.&#xA;I bought this kit on IPMS Ireland Nationals 2024 (lovely show with some spectacular models on display), which adds an emotional attachment to the enjoyment of building it.</description>

      <description>Royal Aircraft Factory BE2c3 The Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 was a British single-engine tractor two-seat biplane designed and developed at the Royal Aircraft Factory. Most production aircraft were constructed under contract by various private companies, both established aircraft manufacturers and firms that had not previously built aircraft. Around 3,500 were manufactured in all.&#xA;from Wikipedia.&#xA;I picked this model on my visit to Royal Air Force Museum London. The museum is absolutely awesome, and they even have BE2b aircraft on display.</description>

      <description>Very good modern kit from Battle of Britain: Ready For Battle set.&#xA;The Albion 3-Point Refueller Not much information available online about this machines. Refuellers like this were in use with the RAF during the Battle of Britain. Apparently having 3 fuel hoses cut down the refuelling time.&#xA;Model quality Almost no flash, great detailed instructions, excellent fit, good decals. Just perfect.&#xA;Build notes The build was straightforward, no fit issues at all.</description>

      <description>Nice little model from Battle of Britain: Ready For Battle set.&#xA;The whole kit is fantastic - it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;new tool&amp;rsquo;, so perfect quality and level of details. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start with truck just to learn how to paint vehicles and try some new techniques. It&amp;rsquo;s the first model I&amp;rsquo;ve painted after I read awesome Adam&amp;rsquo;s Armour book by Adam Wilder, so I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to apply knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve got from the book.</description>

      <description>Once I built up some confidence with wooden kits, especially after St. Gabriel I felt confident enough to start the &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; wooden ship. Like you know, one which you have to plank manually and scratch-build most of stuff. As you probably know, picking the right subject you are really interested in is the key to success. Especially when built is expected to take many months. After careful considerations and reading Model Ship World a lot, I picked this kit from OcCre.</description>

      <title>Leudo, 1/48, Falkonet</title>

      <description>Leudo Leudo is a type of cargo ship, used in Mediterranean Sea to carry various goods. Of course, most people familiar with the subject will think about the wine-carrying type of Leudo, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what this model depicts.
Model quality This is an upgraded Pear version of the kit, so the material quality is very good.
But I have few issues with the design of the kit. Unlike Falkonet&amp;rsquo;s Yawl which was superb, this kit feels over-engineered to the point where it detracts from builder&amp;rsquo;s experience.</description>

      <title>FT-17, 1/35, Meng</title>

      <description>Legendary Renault FT-17, most influential and revolutionary tank design in history. It&amp;rsquo;s so tiny by modern standards that 1/35 model feels like 1/48. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s even more interesting and challenging to build it with full interior.
Model quality It&amp;rsquo;s just perfect, even compared to modern Airfix kits. No flash, very dense and hard plastic allowing amazing level of details, and very detailed build manual. It&amp;rsquo;s the best plastic kit I&amp;rsquo;ve ever built.</description>

      <title>2021 Year in Review</title>
      <link>//models.bulimov.me/models/2021-year-in-review/</link>

      <description>First time I’m doing this ‘year in review’ thing, decided to give it a try.
Turns out, I only completed two models this year, mostly thanks to the fact that sailing ships take enormous amount of time to finish.
I track the days I worked on the models, but not the amount of time, which of course varies from 20 minutes to multiple hours. I can work on more than one model in a single day, so adding those numbers up is kinda misleading.</description>

      <title>Lady Nelson, 1/64, Amati</title>

      <description>I wanted to build a cutter since I first saw someone else build in the modelshipworld.com gallery. They look very graceful and elegant and fast!
HM Cutter Lady Nelson Funny enough, there was no such ship, instead this model depicts an abstract 18th-century British cutter, inspired by Sherbourne-class. As I was attracted by the looks of the subject, not by the history of a particular ship, it didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me.</description>

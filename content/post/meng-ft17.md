Legendary Renault FT-17, [most influential and revolutionary tank design in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_FT).
It's so tiny by modern standards that 1/35 model feels like 1/48. That's why it's even more interesting and challenging to build it with full interior.

## Model quality
It's just *perfect*, even compared to modern [Airfix](/tags/airfix) kits. No flash, very dense and hard plastic allowing amazing level of details, and very detailed build manual.
So far it's the best kit I've ever built. Also it's worth mentioning that kit provides workable tracks and suspension (even with tiny metal spring for amortization).

## Build notes

Completed assembly for engine and transmission. Looks very cool, and really fun to build. Even though most of it will be hidden in full model, it's still worth building just to understand the engineering solutions used in this influential tank.

Assembled workable suspension, absolutely awesome experience.
I've read on the internet that lots of people had problems with it, or found it overengineered, but for me it was a very fun and relatively easy build.

Painted interior walls with Cremmeweise, painted chips with sponge, weathered with AK Interactive washes.
Engine is not yet weathered on the picture, but I'm not going to spend much time on it as it will be barely visible on a finished model.

Very good modern kit from **Battle of Britain: Ready For Battle** set.


## The Albion 3-Point Refueller

Not much information available online about this machines.
Refuellers like this were in use with the RAF during the Battle of Britain.
Apparently having 3 fuel hoses cut down the refuelling time.

## Model quality

Almost no flash, great detailed instructions, excellent fit, good decals. Just perfect.

## Build notes
The build was straightforward, no fit issues at all.

This time I tried to do interesting varied coat of rust colours, partially to get some experience with my new **Iwata Evolution** airbrush.

Then I applied AMMO Heavy Chipping medium, and a base coat of AMMO Mig Khaki Green #3 (A.MIG-113).
After some considerations I decided to try and do camouflage for the first time.
I used BlueTack to mask semi-random pattern based on paintings in kit instructions, and airbrushed it with AMMO Dark Green (A.MIG-915) from RAF colours set.

I'm quite pleased with the result, looks good enough for me.

Once the camo was done I wetted the surface and chipped the paint with a stiff brush, then used a piece of kitchen sponge and AMMO Chipping (A.MIG-044) colour to add chips on the edges.

Applied decals over gloss coat, then airbrushed Tamiya XF-86 Flat Clear.

Weathered with artistic oils from *Windsor&Newton* and various weathering effects from AK Interactive.
Initially I was quite dubious if those weathering stuff was really worth it, but it turned out to be very quick and easy to use. I totally loved it and will definitely buy more of their stuff, as it lasts forever and saves me lots of time and effort mixing stuff.

## Conclusion

Another awesome modern kit from Airfix, had great time building it, and also enjoyed using AK Interactive weathering products for the first time.
Overall I think I'm much more confident about weathering AFV models now, and it's much easier then I expected it to be.

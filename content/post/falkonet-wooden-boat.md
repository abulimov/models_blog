I can't really help it - wooden models attract me more and more.
This one is [yet another](/models/mk-launch) tiny boat kit that I
bought for like 10 Euros on my trip to Russia.

The manufacturer is [Falkonet](http://falkonet.ru), apparently they focus on smaller stuff like boats and yachts,
no tall ships in the catalog so far.

## Wooden boat from year 1763
Some luxurious wooden boat from Catherine The Great era.
Well, basically a typical 6-oar boat with ornaments on the side.

## Model quality
Everything is laser-cut, perfect fit, comprehensible instructions - really can't complain.
Compared to previous one - wood is different, grain is less pronounced so looks better in 1/72.

## Build notes
As with the [previous one](/models/mk-launch) it took me roughly a week to build it, despite it's small size.

Again with a tiny boat like this, instructions make you build a special internal supporting structure before installing ribs and doing planking.

Here is the picture right after I removed all of the fake supporting bulkheads and installed all of the ribs:

I had an 'extras' Photo Etch set for the boat, so replaced crude wooden oarlocks with brass ones, and added an anchor.
As usual, making 1/72 oars is a huge pain in the ass, they are extremely fragile. Luckily kit had plenty of extras.

The kit has optional masts, but no sails, and as I have no idea how to make ones
I decided to postpone installing the masts till I have some experience with it.

## Conclusion
Very enjoyable build and a good looking model, I even proudly placed it on my desk at work.

Continuing the [series of retrospectives](/tags/year-in-review/), let's take a look at year 2024.

Similar to 2023, in a global, geopolitical sense the year was very bad from my perspective, which of course affected my mental well-being.

However, from the modelling standpoint it was not bad at all.

While I only completed one model this year, I had great fun with those in progress, and grew as a modeller while doing so.

## [HMS Flirt](/models/vanguard-flirt)

Started this model in November 2023, and by the end of the year I was done with the planking.

Next seven months were spent painting, adding all the hull detailing and deck furniture. The model now looks very colourful and bright, loving it.

I shelved the build at this point, since the next stage (masts, yards and rigging) is a big undertaking that I was not yet ready to commit to.

## [HMS Alert POF](/models/trident-alert)

My first ever Plank-on-Frame model. I was so excited to start it, and continued to work on it in parallel with the Flirt build.

The learning curve is definitely steep even coming from the POB kits, but the sight of an intricately detailed ship's frame slowly assembling on your desk is absolutely marvellous.

As I've already mentioned, I grew as a modeller with this kit. The tolerances are much tighter with POF, while the shapes are more complex.
Very little room for mistakes, and when I made some I had to learn how to make replacement parts from scratch.

Finished the year with about 1/4 of the frames installed or at least assembled. Very much looking forward to continuing working on this model.

## [RNLI Shannon-class Lifeboat](/models/airfix-rnli-shannon)

The only model I actually finished this year. Had good fun with it, great subject and a nice modern execution by Airfix.

## Conclusion

Modelling continues to help with my mental health, and provides a nice distraction from the IT work and world news.
It is rather challenging working on such big builds that take years to complete,
and adding smaller projects as 'palate cleansers' proves to be crucial in maintaining my mojo.

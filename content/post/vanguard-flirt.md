This model attracted me because of graceful, beautiful lines, and my desire to try a recent model by famous **Chris Watton**.
After all, I quite enjoyed his design in [Lady Nelson](/models/amati-lady-nelson), and the kits from **Vanguard Models** had glowing reviews on a [Model Ship World](https://modelshipworld.com) forum.

## HM Brig Sloop Flirt

There is nothing remarkable about ship herself. She was built in 1782 and had a relatively uneventful career in the Navy.

'Brig' in the full name means that she had two masts, both with a square rig, and 'sloops' was a class of small support vessels.

## Model quality

The design seems quite good so far, but the plank quality was all over the place, and there was barely enough of them.


## Build notes


Built all the bulkheads and false keel in just one day, including lower deck and false deck installation.

Very good engineering throughout - longitudinal reinforcements make aligning bulkheads and making them square to the keel very easy. It’s practically impossible to somehow twist the hull with such design, very well done and makes the build faster and easier.

All parts fit amazingly well, no gaps, no need to sand pieces to reduce thickness either.

So far the only issue I had was that the instructions said that bulkheads will have etched lines for sanding, but in my case they didn’t - I suspect that few of my plates came from Speedy which is a bit older design.

And how cool is that - my first model with a lower deck, and VM provided a great looking laser etched birch deck, even with the door down there, despite it being barely visible through hatches.

Faring the hull was easy (it always is when MDF is used, plywood is *much* harder to sand), but applying gunport patterns was utter shitshow.
I have no idea how one could bend them into submission, so they lay properly on the bulkheads.
Spent two hours on this stage, hated it all the way and the result is far from good.
Hopefully I’ll just sand all the bumps and bulges away after the first layer planking.
Still this stage is poorly designed, and I expected better experience from the advanced Vanguard Model kit.

Nails included in the kit are weird - the head is too small, and most importantly they are not magnetic, which makes using them with the nail pusher a pure exercise in frustration. Luckily I have tons of OcCre nails which are tougher and magnetic.

First layer of planking went easy, no issues except for the aforementioned nails.


Sanding on the other hand was the part I didn’t look forward to.
To me, it is always one of the most mind-numbingly boring parts, and quite messy as well.

I always try to do it outside, thankfully it’s easy when you live in a house. Still few boring and tedious hours spent in the cold is not something I can enjoy.

And first attempt at sanding didn’t go well at all - I clumsily dropped the hull and broke the stem piece, and the rain started and prevented me from doing any real sanding.

So instead of sanding I repaired the broken piece.
Some days later I managed to finish the sanding without doing more damage.

Thankfully after the sanding first layer of planking looks splendid, and I was eager to start with the finial layer.

Here you can see how I thinned the deadwood area in the stern. A bit too much actually, I had to build it up a bit with a wood filler before the second planking.

Second layer is made from pear, which is a very pleasant wood to work with.

I'm a rather disappointed with the plank quality in the kit. While all the planks have equal width, thinness varies, and plenty of planks have imperfections like dents or saw marks.

Still it is a nice wood, and quite pliable as well, which allowed me to continue spiling the planks free-hand so to speak, without using specialised jigs or soaking planks in hot water. I did the usual calculations for the spiling (what width should the plank be at which bulkhead), but based on my experience with the first planking layer I went with 'natural flow' approach. First layer went so well and the hull shape is really easy to plank that the natural planking looks, well, more natural!

Second planing went quite well. 'Natural' method worked remarkably well, the bow looks pretty good. First time used stealer planks for the stern (I simply used wedges before as this area is painted anyway)  simply because I wanted to try it. Doesn't look half bad, and wasn't much harder to make than wedges.

Very happy that this messy, lengthy, tricky process is over. It is too easy to mess up, and it just takes so long, plus I am tired of having my fingers covered with CA glue. And in general I much prefer PVA, but with it the planking would have taken forever.

Sanding the second layer was as boring as with the first one, but luckily there were no issues or surprises.

Next photo is from the later stage, but shows the bow planking nicely.

Gluing the laser-etched deck was trivial, used plenty of clamps and some extra weight to make ensure good bond. I lightly sanded some slightly charred parts of the deck with 1200 grit sandpaper, which was enough to remove the char without damaging the etching.

![wip_05](/images/models/vanguard-flirt/wip_05_1920.jpg)

Planking the inside of the bulwarks was a nice change from slightly annoying outer planking, as I switched from CA to PVA.
I want the best possible bond around the gunports (so that the planks don't detach when I cut them open), and having glue residue is no problem as it will all be pained anyway
I pre-painted the lower plank to avoid masking the deck afterward, and left the rest unpainted in the anticipation of sanding.
Also, it was again confirmed that one cannot simply have enough clamps!

Planking the bulwarks on the outside I also did with PVA for same reason - good bond around all openings. Took longer but I'm confident in the result.

Sadly it became clear now that I don't have enough of 4x1 mm pear planks. I needed another two for wales (they are 3 + 4 mm, and I have 3 mm with spares but none 4 mm left). Will use remaining butts that I cut off during the planking, the wales are painted black anyway, but it is quite disappointing to have such basic issues with a 300 pound kit.

Also, it's really weird that in the plans the wales are 8 mm wide, and the laser cut parts attaching to them are designed for 8 mm, but the instructions clearly say it's 3 + 4 mm. Confusing at best, but as I don't have enough materials to make them 8 mm I'll go with the instructions.

I have also noticed that the transom on my model looks slightly different from what is in the instructions/plans, more curved.
Don't know what went wrong (if anything), but that was the only way to fare the bulkheads when I was building the hull.
I'm completely fine with this small difference, it will simply mean I'll have to bend the wales more, and probably modify one part for the stern decoration.


Building the wales was easy, although I had to build up the lower 4 mm strip from 3 pieces on both sides simply because I completely ran out of 4x1 mm pear strips. No biggie, still turned out great.

Glued in the stempost piece, decent fit, although I expected better. Even before the laser char removal there were few 1 mm gaps. Again, no biggie as it will be filled and painted anyway.
Left the glue to dry overnight as per instructions, glued in the rest of the keel next day, and fully painted the bulwarks. I love using the *Admiralty Models* paint, it is pretty much perfect for the brush application on wood.

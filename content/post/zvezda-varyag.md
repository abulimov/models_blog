## Protected Cruiser Varyag
Built in USA in 1899 for the Imperial Russian Navy,
[Varyag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cruiser_Varyag_(1899)) became very famous
in Russia after the Battle of Chemulpo Bay. In that battle, she got trapped
in the bay and tried to break out by fighting against Japanese squadron.
Sadly she scored no hits on the enemy, 
lost 31 men dead and 191 injured, returned back to the bay and got scuttled.

The Russian government took the opportunity to turn this very unsuccessful battle
into a publicity stunt. The crew was decorated for their bravery, and the whole thing
widely covered in papers. Such publicity inspired a song to be written about it,
which still remains popular in Russia.

## Model quality
Typical modern Zvezda kit. Good details, almost no flash, ok-ish instructions.

I used PhotoEtch kit by **Eduard**, and wooden deck by **Hunter** - both are absolutely excellent.

## Build notes

It's the first time I'm using a wooden veneer deck. Needless to say, it completely
transforms the look of the model, but adds a lot of complications to the build.

Not only it requires the removal of some of the plastic details (nothing new
to me, as most of the PhotoEtch details sets require similar modifications), it also
significantly changes the build order. It's very hard to remove paint from it,
so I'm not risking any overspray and thus not masking it - instead I'm painting all
the related parts and surroundings before the deck application.

And of course using PhotoEtch details adds even more complexity.
I'm evaluating all the replacements, and in many cases the
result is not worth the effort, while some of the added details
are simply too fiddly for me. Nevertheless, Eduard's set
is an excellent addition.

Here is the part of the superstructure before and after painting.
Deck is dry fitted on the first photo. Plastic bridge was removed,
and a more detailed PhotoEtch replacement was installed.

Here is the deck parts, before and after painting and
glueing the wooden deck on top of the plastic one.
The difference is massive, and I could have never
achieved the same look with paint alone.

And finally a steam launch with all the PE details and drilled out funnel.
I always drill out the gun barrels and funnels, it's easy and it adds a lot
to the look of the model.

One of the most challenging bits was adding the stern gallery.
It's quite flimsy, made of very fine PE, and I even had to remove some of
the most fragile parts as there was no way they would survive anyway.

Also at this point I drilled all the portholes, and made two
big mounting holes in the bottom of the hull. I then glued in
the nuts for the display base bolts with CA glue.

I greatly appreciated the replacement parts with railings already attached,
this made building the model more enjoyable. And if someone builds the model
without a wooden deck - just look at the nice plank details that come with PE parts!

![wip_07](/images/models/zvezda-varyag/wip_07_1920.jpg)

Here you can see hull painted, and three deck parts glued in.
I didn't want to pain the ship white with yellow funnels
(which was a real paint scheme for her for some time).

While it looks glorious, I simply hate dealing with white paint - it takes
too many coats to have good coverage, it's a pain to dry (at least with Tamiya),
and I had no idea how to weather such model.

So instead I went with realistic **AK Interactive** *Neutral Haze Gray* and *Hull Red*.
The book I have about this ship suggests greenish-grey
above and red below the waterline as a paint scheme for 1904.

I was eager to install the decks, as I had tons of parts prepared for them,
just waiting to be glued on. Things like funnels, smoke stacks, guns -
all was cleaned, assembled and painted separately.

The 'stand' you see is obviously temporary - at this point
I didn't yet have real piece of wood
to use for the base, but already had the screws and brass columns.

I learned that having the model securely mounted on the display base early on
is extremely helpful and convenient. It allows to easy handling and safe storage
since early stages of the build.

I'm happy to report that thanks to this base 
I didn't knock off any of the parts, nor did I left any paint fingerprints on the hull!

So once I had the decks installed it was relatively fast to get to the almost final look,
as I had all of the parts ready to be attached.

Here you can see the ship with most of the details done
(only the ship boats are left out for now), and no weathering done.

Dealing with PE railings and ladders was not too bad - Eduard's PE is excellent,
most of the stuff fit right in.

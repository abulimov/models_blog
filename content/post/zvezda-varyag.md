## Protected Cruiser Varyag
Built in USA in 1899 for the Imperial Russian Navy,
[Varyag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cruiser_Varyag_(1899)) became very famous
in Russia after the Battle of Chemulpo Bay. In that battle, she got trapped
in the bay and tried to break out by fighting against Japanese squadron.
Sadly she scored no hits on the enemy, 
lost 31 men dead and 191 injured, returned back to the bay and got scuttled.

The Russian government took the opportunity to turn this very unsuccessful battle
into a publicity stunt. The crew was decorated for their bravery, and the whole thing
widely covered in papers. Such publicity inspired a song to be written about it,
which still remains popular in Russia.

## Model quality
Typical modern Zvezda kit. Good details, almost no flash, ok-ish instructions.

I used PhotoEtch kit by Eduard, and wooden deck by Hunter - both excellent.

## Build notes

It's the first time I'm using a wooden veneer deck. Needless to say, it completely
transforms the look of the model, but adds a lot of complications to the build.

Not only it requires the removal of some of the plastic details (nothing new
to me, as most of the PhotoEtch details sets require similar modifications), it also
significantly changes the build order. It's very hard to remove paint from it,
so I'm not risking any overspray and thus not masking it - instead I'm painting all
the related parts and surroundings before the deck application.

And of course using PhotoEtch details adds even more complexity.
I'm evaluating all the replacements, and in many cases the
result is not worth the effort, while some of the added details
are simply too fiddly for me. Nevertheless, Eduard's set
is an excellent addition.

Here is the part of the superstructure before and after painting.
Deck is dry fitted on the first photo. Plastic bridge was removed,
and a more detailed PhotoEtch replacement was installed.

Here is the deck parts, before and after painting and
glueing the wooden deck on top of the plastic one.
The difference is massive, and I could have never
achieved the same look with paint alone.

And finally a steam launch with all the PE details and drilled out funnel.
I always drill out the gun barrels and funnels, it's easy and it adds a lot
to the look of the model.

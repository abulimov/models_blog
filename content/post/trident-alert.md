Since I started building wooden kits, I looked at the Plank-on-Frame models with great awe.
Exposing the internal structure of the ship with all the beautiful complexity is extremely appealing to me as an engineer.

This year my wife convinced me to take the plunge and try to build one myself.

After building [10+ wooden models](/tags/woodenkit/) I felt confident enough to attempt building some small and well-made POF kit.

Seeing a group build for this model on **[Ships of Scale forums](https://shipsofscale.com)**,
along with the [positive reviews](https://modelshipworld.com/topic/26095-148-hms-alert-1777-trident-model) and acceptable price (around 600EUR after import taxes)
helped me to make the decision in favour of this kit from the new Chinese manufacturer **Trident Models**. It is their first kit, and they don't even
have a website, but every single person who built it seem to be happy with the model.

And what's also important to me is that according to the [announcement topic on the **Model Ship World** forum](https://modelshipworld.com/topic/20948-new-148-scale-pof-kit-of-the-cutter-alert-from-trident-models-in-china),
the kit is clear from the legal standpoint, completely original design.

My wife happily bought the kit for me as a Christmas gift, which got delivered from China to Ireland in less than 3 weeks.
 
## The Naval Cutter Alert 1777

The ship is well documented thanks to the surviving plans and a book in the **Anatomy of the Ship* series, by Peter Goodwin.
To me the main attraction was just how graceful and beautiful this cutter is.
But the fact that it is so well documented is a big plus.

## Model quality

It is pretty remarkable. Good 4 kg of mostly CNC-cut cherry wood. I carefully examined the content and everything was in order,
no defects on the wooden parts, or cast metal bits.

By the way I love that most of the parts are cut by CNC, not laser, it was one of the reasons to start with this kit.
Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Laser Cutters, and have access to one myself at work. I regularly use it for various things like
storage cabinets, boxes, tool racks and such.

But cleaning the char is definitely not my favourite pastime. I know that if I ever attempt a laser-cut POF model, I would need to buy
a disk sander.

Anyway, going back to the kit quality - metal castings seem to be of pretty good quality as well, and even include the galley stove.

What is not good is instructions. They are written in very broken English. Hopefully the pictures and existing build logs should be enough.

## Build notes

**I'm in awe of the complexity of this kit.** 
It took me an hour just to go through the part list and check that everything is in order.
I didn't clear the sawdust, it would have taken another hour.

I'm frankly intimidated by the complexity of this relatively small Plank-on-Frame kit.

Started with the keel assembly, as per instructions.
It consists of around 20 parts, as on the real ship. Can't get much cooler than that!
It was daunting for sure, but very exciting and satisfying differently from the [HMS Flirt](/models/vanguard-flirt/) which I'm building in parallel.

CNC cut parts are very impressive and require little clean up, but I'm very careful not to damage anything, so it still takes some time.
Interestingly enough the CNC cut is not perfectly vertical, and just as with laser cut there is a slight angle that needs sanding to ensure good fit.
Hopefully I've done a good enough job with the keel. It is assembled in a laser cut plywood template, which really helps with the alignment.
I was very cautious not to sand the parts too much, making sure they sit perfectly in the template.
Which of course meant sacrificing the tightness of the fit between the parts, which would make the whole assembly slightly smaller.

The wood is said to be Cherry, of very high quality, and I love it. Very easy to work with, very smooth with small grain.

Sanding the deadwood for the rabbet was rather easy, especially given that the kit provides a template for it, quite convenient.

Glueing another stem piece proved very nerve wrenching, I tried to make the fit perfect but only made it worse, and spent many more minutes trying
to somehow make it better. I think I succeeded, and in this particular part the ideal alignment is not necessary.

And more importantly I learned my lesson and will avoid trying to make curved parts fit perfectly, it is too risky.
Rest of the keel assembly was easier, did both lower and upper halves (or rather quarters, as each was also split in half for convenience),
then did a rabbet line on them. It was done by hand, mostly by via the sanding block, with some scraping with the scalpel blade to achieve sharper lines.
Nothing difficult, just slow careful work, rather enjoyable because the wood is very pleasant to work with.

Finally, all the keel parts were glued together inside the plywood template, while laying flat on the table
covered in plastic food wrap, and clamped with massive spring clamps.

Next part of the keel assembly was quite laborious and requiring very careful work.
I needed to shape the wing transom by using (very handy) paper templates stickers. Took good few hours, but looks pretty good in my opinion,
follows the stickers perfectly and fits right where it should.

Shaping the cant frame supports was much easier, just a bit tedious as again I was very
careful and all this was done by hand.

The complete keel assembly turned out great, and after a small rabbet line clean up and a couple of fillings
with dark wood filler I call it done.

Next step is installing the keel in a building jig, and assembling this jig is a serious task. It took me 2h
to build it, with big chunk of time spent on sanding all the joints ever so slightly, otherwise the fit was too tight. I sanded the parts where keel
touched the jig, and then brushed a coat of acrylic varnish to make sure there will be no char marks on the keel.
